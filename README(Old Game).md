# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Turtle module in Python.

## Description

The Snake Game allows the player to control a snake using the arrow keys. The objective is to eat the food that appears on the screen and grow the snake as long as possible without colliding with the boundaries of the game window or with itself.

The game features include:

- Snake movement in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- Randomly generated food that the snake needs to eat.
- Collision detection to handle self-collision and food collision.
- Wrapping of the snake when it reaches the boundaries of the game window.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the required module by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install turtle
   ```
4. Run the `snake_game.py` file using Python:
   ```
   python snake_game.py
   ```

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction:
  - Up arrow: Move the snake up
  - Right arrow: Move the snake right
  - Down arrow: Move the snake down
  - Left arrow: Move the snake left
