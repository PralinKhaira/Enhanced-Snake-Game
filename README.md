# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game features various enhancements and additional features, including scoring, levels/speed increase, collision with boundaries, obstacles/walls, game over condition, visual design improvements, two-player mode, and power-ups.

## How to Play

1. Run the `snake_game.py` file using Python.
2. Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys.
3. Avoid self-collision, collision with boundaries, and obstacles.
4. Collect the food (red circles) to increase your score.
5. As the score increases, the level and speed of the game will increase.
6. Press the spacebar to switch to two-player mode, where the snake's direction will be reversed.
7. Power-ups (randomly generated) can appear on the screen. Collect them to gain special abilities.
